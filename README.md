```Dandylion``` is the first place winner of the 2021 hackathon hosten by DandyHacks along with Major League hacking.

## Use Case
As young adults who hope to one day make a positive difference in the world, we started thinking of ways we could use our skills with different programming languages and frameworks to better the world around us. We then had the idea to create Dandelion. Just like a real Dandelion, our app takes a part of itself wherever it goes bringing communities together and smiles to the faces of those in its path. In a more formal sense, our program allows users to crowd source labor from willing members of the community.
